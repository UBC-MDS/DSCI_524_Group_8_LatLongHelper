    "text": "A package for cleaning and utilizing geospatial data. Allows the use of geospatial data to help create summarizations such as distance calculations or rudimentary visualizations via latitude–longitude binning.\nFunctions included:\n\nLatLongDistance: calculates the distance (in kilometres) between two geographic points given their latitude and longitude coordinates.\nLatLongBinning: bins latitude and longitude into different groups to aid in grouping or for use in PlotBinnedLatLong.\nPlotBinnedLatLong: visualizes binned geographic coordinates on a heatmap.\n\nLatLongDistance is a common function found in many packages such as GeoPy and Haversine. However, binning and plotting such binned latitudes and longitudes does not currently exist. Current methods to bin require the use of multiple Pandas functions to do so. We aim to create a simplification of the binning and their plot without the user’s having to rely on multiple uses and transformation on their part.\n\n\nBinning latitude and longitude refers to grouping nearby geographic points into fixed-size grid cells.\nFor example, with a grid size of 0.05°, all points whose latitudes fall between 49.25 and 49.30 and longitudes between −123.20 and −123.15 would be assigned to the same bin. This is useful for:\n\naggregating spatial data\ncounting observations in geographic regions\ncreating density-style visualizations (e.g., heatmaps)\nreducing noise in very precise GPS data\n\n\n\n\nBelow is an example heatmap produced by PlotBinnedLatLong, showing the spatial density of binned latitude–longitude points. \n\n\n\nfrom latlonghelper.lat_long_binning import LatLongBinning\nfrom latlonghelper.lat_long_distance import LatLongDistance\nfrom latlonghelper.plot_binned_lat_long import PlotBinnedLatLong\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Example coordinates (Vancouver area)\nlatitudes = [49.2606, 49.2827, 49.2685]\nlongitudes = [-123.2460, -123.1207, -123.1686]\n\n# Bin coordinates\nbinned = []\nfor lat, lon in zip(latitudes, longitudes):\n    binned.append(LatLongBinning(lat, lon, 0.05, 0.05))\n\n# Plot heatmap\nax = PlotBinnedLatLong(binned)\nplt.show()\n\n# Distance example\ndistance = LatLongDistance(49.2606, -123.2460, 49.2827, -123.1207)\nprint(distance)\nMore detailed examples and tutorials are available on the documentation website.\n\n\n\nFull documentation, including API references and examples, is available at:\n👉 https://UBC-MDS.github.io/latlonghelper/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython 3.8+\npip\n\n\n\n\nClone the repository and install the package in editable mode:\ngit clone https://github.com/UBC-MDS/latlonghelper\ncd latlonghelper\n\n\n\nIf you are using conda, you can create the development environment using:\nconda env create -f environment.yml\nconda activate latlonghelper-env\npip install -e .\n\n\n\n\nYou can run the tests for this package using pytest.
